A high school sophomore from the San Francisco Bay Area, Adam is interested in science, engineering, math and finance. He is also an *anytime* intern at a [robotics startup](https://watneyrobotics.com) in San Francisco. Adam hopes to one day become a quant trading roboticist like his older brother with whom he has always enjoyed working.

Adam loves rock climbing because it's similar to puzzle solving where one finds a path by connecting dots on the wall. He enjoys listening to music or playing the guitar on quiet evenings when there is no homework. Adam frequents the farmers' market on Sundays and on occasion finds time to cook a sumptuous steak dinner, too.

Adam is looking forward to taking a popular [computer science class](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2025-summer-compsci-61a-001-lec-001) at UC Berkeley this summer as a pre-college scholar after he turns 16. He plans to begin [flying lessons](https://wvfc.org) soon as he is old enough to drive. Adam hopes to earn a pilot license before heading out to college, where he will pursue a double major in engineering and finance.
