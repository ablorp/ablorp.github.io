A high school sophomore from the San Francisco Bay Area, Adam is interested in science, engineering, math and finance. He is also an intern at a [robotics startup](https://watneyrobotics.com) in San Francisco, and hopes to one day become a roboticist â€” just like his eldest brother with whom he has always enjoyed working.

Adam loves to climb rocks, surf waves, ski downhill, and run cross-country; he enjoys listening to music or playing the guitar on quiet evenings when there is no homework. Adam frequents the farmers' market on Sundays and on occasion finds time to cook a sumptuous steak dinner, too.

Adam is looking forward to taking a [computer science class](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2025-summer-compsci-61a-001-lec-001) at UC Berkeley this summer as a pre-college scholar after he turns 16. He plans to start taking [flying lessons](https://wvfc.org) soon as he is old enough to drive. Adam hopes to earn a pilot license before heading out to college, where he will pursue a double major in engineering and finance.
