A high school sophomore from the San Francisco Bay Area with a strong interest in science, engineering, math and finance, Adam holds a year-round internship at a [robotics startup](https://watneyrobotics.com) in San Francisco. Adam aspires to become a quant trading roboticist like his eldest brother, who has inspired in Adam a curiosity in all things robotic.

Adam loves rock climbing because it's like solving a puzzle: connecting the dots forward to envision a new path of ascent. From mechanical engineering to computational biology, Adam's [projects](https://adamcheong.com/projects/) since 7th grade have won numerous STEM fair awards. On quiet evenings, Adam enjoys playing the guitar and listening to his favorite artists.

Adam is looking forward to taking a popular [computer science class](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2025-summer-compsci-61a-001-lec-001) at UC Berkeley as a pre-college scholar this summer after he turns 16. He plans to begin [flying lessons](https://wvfc.org) soon as he is old enough to drive. Adam hopes to earn a pilot license before heading out to college, where he will pursue a double major in engineering and finance.
